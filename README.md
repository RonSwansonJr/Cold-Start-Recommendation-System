# Cold-Start-Recommendation-System
Analysis and comparison of clustering models to solve cold start problem.
- Compared K-Means euclidean,Kernel K-means(RBF,chi,chi2,additive_chi2,laplacian),Agglormerative Clustering(manhattan,L1 norm,L2 norm),OPTICS,WARD,BIRCH
- Used 5 fold Cross Validation with MAE
